# AXIS Bank Account Management System

This is a simple C-based program that simulates a basic account management system for a bank. The system allows users to create new accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, check balances, and manage fixed deposits, all while ensuring security through PIN verification.

## Features

- **Account Creation**: Users can create a new account with personal information such as name, contact number, address, email, PIN, and initial deposit.
- **Deposit**: Users can deposit money into their account after authenticating with their account number and PIN.
- **Withdrawal**: Users can withdraw funds from their account after authenticating with their account number and PIN.
- **Check Balance**: Users can view their account balance after verifying their account number and PIN.
- **Fixed Deposit**: Users can make fixed deposits into their account after authenticating with their account number and PIN.
- **Account Management**: Administrators can view details of all created accounts including name, balance, fixed deposit amount, and other information.

## Technologies Used

- **C Programming Language**: The program is implemented in C, with a focus on basic data structures such as arrays and structures to handle account data.
- **Standard Input/Output**: The program uses the standard input and output functions (`scanf`, `printf`) for interaction with the user.
